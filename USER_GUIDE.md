## Commands

7 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

### Using the Meta-Skill

Start with `@skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md` to discover which skill applies to your current task. This meta-skill contains:

- A **flowchart** that maps task types to the appropriate skill
- **Core operating behaviors** (surface assumptions, manage confusion, push back when warranted, enforce simplicity)
- **Failure modes** to avoid
- **Lifecycle sequences** for complete features

---

## Quick Start

For step-by-step setup instructions, see the [getting-started.md](docs/ai-agent-setup/getting-started.md) guide.

**TL;DR:**

```bash
# 1. Install Context7 for documentation
npx ctx7@latest setup

# 2. Start with the meta-skill
Use @skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md

# 3. Load essential skills for your task
Load @skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md    # Define
Load @skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md    # Build
Load @skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md   # Review

# 4. Use commands for workflow automation
/spec → /plan → /build → /test → /review → /ship
```

---

## All 21 Base Skills

The commands above are the entry points. Under the hood, they activate these 21 base skills — each one a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any base skill or the Skill Extras below directly.

### Define - Clarify what to build

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [idea-refine](skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md) | Structured divergent/convergent thinking to turn vague ideas into concrete proposals | You have a rough concept that needs exploration |
| [spec-driven-development](skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Write a PRD covering objectives, commands, structure, code style, testing, and boundaries before any code | Starting a new project, feature, or significant change |

| [debugging-and-error-recovery](skills/debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md) | Five-step triage: reproduce, localize, reduce, fix, guard. Stop-the-line rule, safe fallbacks | Tests fail, builds break, or behavior is unexpected |

### Review - Quality gates before merge

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [code-review-and-quality](skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md) | Five-axis review, change sizing (~100 lines), severity labels (Nit/Optional/FYI), review speed norms, splitting strategies | Before merging any change |
| [code-simplification](skills/code-simplification/SKILL.md) | Chesterton's Fence, Rule of 500, reduce complexity while preserving exact behavior | Code works but is harder to read or maintain than it should be |
| [security-and-hardening](skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md) | OWASP Top 10 prevention, auth patterns, secrets management, dependency auditing, three-tier boundary system | Handling user input, auth, data storage, or external integrations |
| [performance-optimization](skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md) | Measure-first approach - Core Web Vitals targets, profiling workflows, bundle analysis, anti-pattern detection | Performance requirements exist or you suspect regressions |

### Ship - Deploy with confidence

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [git-workflow-and-versioning](skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/SKILL.md) | Trunk-based development, atomic commits, change sizing (~100 lines), the commit-as-save-point pattern | Making any code change (always) |
| [ci-cd-and-automation](skills/ci-cd-and-automation/SKILL.md) | Shift Left, Faster is Safer, feature flags, quality gate pipelines, failure feedback loops | Setting up or modifying build and deploy pipelines |
| [deprecation-and-migration](skills/deprecation-and-migration/SKILL.md) | Code-as-liability mindset, compulsory vs advisory deprecation, migration patterns, zombie code removal | Removing old systems, migrating users, or sunsetting features |
| [documentation-and-adrs](skills/documentation-and-adrs/SKILL.md) | Architecture Decision Records, API docs, inline documentation standards - document the *why* | Making architectural decisions, changing APIs, or shipping features |
| [shipping-and-launch](skills/shipping-and-launch/SKILL.md) | Pre-launch checklists, feature flag lifecycle, staged rollouts, rollback procedures, monitoring setup | Preparing to deploy to production |

### Skill Extras

Additional skills that extend the template across multiple phases. Skill Extras are **loaded explicitly** by the agent when the task matches their trigger conditions — they do not activate automatically via slash commands. Load them with `Load @skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|

| [design-taste-frontend](skills/design-taste-frontend/SKILL.md) | Define criterios de buen gusto y consistencia visual en frontend con reglas métricas | Cuando necesitas validar decisiones de estilo y coherencia visual |
| [solid](skills/solid/SKILL.md) | Apply SOLID principles, TDD, clean code, and professional software design | Writing, refactoring, or reviewing any code |
| [ui-ux-design-pro](skills/ui-ux-design-pro/SKILL.md) | Diseño UI/UX profesional con sistemas de diseño, tokens, paletas y prototipado de alta fidelidad | Cuando necesitas diseñar interfaces atractivas, accesibles y centradas en el usuario |

## Agent Personas

> **For detailed information on how agents work, see [AGENTS_GUIDE.md](AGENTS_GUIDE.md).**

Pre-configured specialist personas for targeted reviews:

| Agent | Role | Perspective | Use When |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| [code-reviewer](agents/code-reviewer.md) | Senior Staff Engineer | Five-axis code review with "would a staff engineer approve this?" standard | Before merging any change |
| [test-engineer](agents/test-engineer.md) | QA Specialist | Test strategy, coverage analysis, and the Prove-It pattern | Writing tests or analyzing coverage |
| [security-auditor](agents/security-auditor.md) | Security Engineer | Vulnerability detection, threat modeling, OWASP assessment | Security-sensitive changes |
| [analysis](agents/analysis.md) | Architect of Specifications | Spec-Driven Analysis, planning, and design | Before writing code — analyze, design, or plan |

### When to Use Each

- **Direct invocation**: When you want one perspective on a single artifact
  - "Review this PR" → invoke `code-reviewer`
  - "Check for security issues" → invoke `security-auditor`
  - "What tests are missing?" → invoke `test-engineer`
  - "Analyze this feature and create a plan" → invoke `analysis`

- **Via commands**: When there's a repeatable workflow
  - `/review` → wraps `code-reviewer` with the project's review skill
  - `/ship` → fans out to all three personas in parallel, then synthesizes reports

### How Personas Relate to Skills and Commands

Three composable layers, each with a distinct job:

| Layer | What it is | Example | Composition role |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **Skill** | A workflow with steps and exit criteria | `code-review-and-quality` | The *how* — mandatory hops when an intent matches |
| **Persona** | A role with a perspective and output format | `code-reviewer` | The *who* — adopts a viewpoint, produces a report |
| **Command** | A user-facing entry point | `/review`, `/ship` | The *when* — composes personas and skills |

**Rules:**
- **Personas do not invoke other personas.** Skills are mandatory hops inside a persona's workflow.
- The only multi-persona pattern endorsed is **parallel fan-out with a merge step** — used by `/ship` to run all three personas concurrently.

> **For detailed orchestration patterns and decision matrix, see [AGENTS_GUIDE.md](AGENTS_GUIDE.md).**

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows a consistent anatomy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL.md                                       │
│                                                 │
│  ┌─ Frontmatter ─────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ name: lowercase-hyphen-name               │  │
│  │ description: Guides agents through [task].│  │
│  │              Use when…                    │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────┘  │                                                                                                
│  Overview         → What this skill does        │
│  When to Use      → Triggering conditions       │
│  Process          → Step-by-step workflow       │
│  Rationalizations → Excuses + rebuttals         │
│  Red Flags        → Signs something's wrong     │
│  Verification     → Evidence requirements       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Process, not prose.** Skills are workflows agents follow, not reference docs they read. Each has steps, checkpoints, and exit criteria.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Verification is non-negotiable.** Every skill ends with evidence requirements - tests passing, build output, runtime data. "Seems right" is never sufficient.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The `SKILL.md` is the entry point. Supporting references load only when needed, keeping token usage minimal.

## Template-Specific Tools

This template includes tools that enhance AI-assisted development:

### Context7 (ctx7)

**Purpose:** Fetch up-to-date documentation for any library, framework, or SDK.

**Installation:**
```bash
npx ctx7@latest setup
```

**Usage:** The `find-docs` skill is automatically invoked when you ask about API syntax, configuration options, or how to use a specific technology. You can also use it directly:

```bash
npx ctx7@latest library <library-name> "<query>"
npx ctx7@latest docs <library-id> "<query>"
```

### Available Skills

This template includes several skills for documentation and development:

| Skill | Purpose | Use When |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `find-docs` | Retrieve up-to-date documentation using Context7 | Asking about libraries, frameworks, or APIs |
| `source-driven-development` | Ground implementation in official docs | Building with any framework or library |
| `crafting-effective-readmes` | Write or improve READMEs for any project type | Writing or improving README files |
| `design-patterns` | Apply GoF and enterprise design patterns | Solving recurring design problems |
| `solid` | Apply SOLID principles and clean code | Writing, refactoring, or reviewing code |
| `clean-ddd-hexagonal` | Clean Architecture + DDD + Hexagonal patterns | Designing APIs, microservices, or complex backends |
| `bash-defensive-patterns` | Defensive Bash scripting (strict mode, traps, safe variable handling) | Writing robust shell scripts or CI/CD pipelines |
| `agent-md-refactor` | Refactor bloated agent instruction files | Your AGENTS.md is too long or contradictory |

## Creating a New Skill

For detailed guidance on creating new skills, see these documents:

| Document | Covers |
|----------|--------|
| [docs/ai-agent-setup/skill-anatomy.md](docs/ai-agent-setup/skill-anatomy.md) | Complete skill anatomy: file structure, SKILL.md format, frontmatter, standard sections, writing principles |
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Quality bar, structure requirements, what to do and what not to do when adding skills |

**Quick reference:**
- Create `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` with kebab-case naming
- Include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` (include "Use when" triggers)
- Follow standard sections: Overview, When to Use, Process, Rationalizations, Red Flags, Verification
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; use progressive disclosure for detailed content
- Reference other skills instead of duplicating content
- Put reference material in `references/` at project root, not inside skill directories

---

## Why Agent Skills?

AI coding agents default to the shortest path - which often means skipping specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. Agent Skills gives agents structured workflows that enforce the same discipline senior engineers bring to production code.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

---

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).

See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the format specification and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
